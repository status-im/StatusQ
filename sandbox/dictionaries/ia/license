Affix and Composition Rules:
============================

Affix rules based on "A Grammar of Interlingua", Alexander Gode & Hugh Blair, IALA 1951,
	(http://members.optus.net/~ado_hall/interlingua/gi/home/entry_page.html)

Composition rules generate ordinal numerals (3tie, 12nde, 1000me etc.)

Naming of 'big numbers' follows a nomenclature described by Conway and Wechsler.

Hyphenation Rules:
=================

The rules have been built from scratch using the method described in:
	--- "How to make a foreign language pattern file: Romanian",
		http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb16-1/tb46bec2.pdf.

The hyphenation rules were adopted mainly from Italian, Spanish, Romanian and German.

 1. a single consonant between two vowels belongs to the second syllable
 2. digraphs bh, ch, dh, gh, kh, ph, rh, sh, th and zh are considered a single consonant
 3. two consonants are divided between vowels unless an l or an r follows b, c, d, f, k, g, p, t, v
    the same rules applies to a group of three consonans starting with ch, gh, kh, ph, sh, th
 4. initial or final cluster of consonants are not devided
 5. three consonants are divided after the first one if the group ends with
    a) l or r following b, c, d, f, g, k, p, t or v
    d) bh, ch, dh, gh, kh, ph, rh, sh, th and zh
    c) sc, sk, sp or st
    d) otherwise, they are divided after the second consonant
 6. four consonants are divided after the first one if the group ends with
    a) l or r following sc, sk, sp or st
    b) sch, sph or sth
   and they are devided after the second one
    c) if l or r does not follow sc, sk, sp or st
    d) or the group ends with ch, ph, sh or th
    e) in all other cases a group of four consonst is devided after the third consonant
 7. never devide before or after an apostrophe
 8. patterns adjusted for compound words,  "guest" words or etymology
